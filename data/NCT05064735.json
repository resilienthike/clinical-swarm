It will also look at how much pain participants have in participants knee from the start to the end of the study and how this affects participants daily life. This is to compare the effect on body weight and pain in the knee in people taking semaglutide with people taking \"dummy\" medicine. Participants will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance.\n\nParticipants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. During the study, participants will have talks with study staff about how to eat healthy food and how to be more physically active. The study will last for about 1 ½ years. Participants will have 14 clinic visits with the study staff. At the first clinic visit participants will have a blood sample taken. Participants will have an X-ray of participants knee taken at the first visit. If participants have had an X-ray recently, this may not be needed.\n\nAt 6 of the clinic visits participants cannot take pain medications for 3 days before the visit. Participants cannot take part if participants have had a joint replacement surgery in participants knee. Participants cannot take part if participants have or have had diabetes. Women: Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":407,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"semaglutide 2.4 mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c) 2.4 mg once-weekly as adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity","interventionNames":["Drug: semaglutide 2.4 mg"]},{"label":"semaglutide 2.4 mg (placebo)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c) placebo once-weekly as adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity","interventionNames":["Drug: semaglutide 2.4 mg (placebo)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"semaglutide 2.4 mg","description":"semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once-weekly or semaglutide placebo once-weekly as adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity","armGroupLabels":["semaglutide 2.4 mg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"semaglutide 2.4 mg (placebo)","description":"semaglutide subcutanous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once-weekly or semaglutide placebo once-weekly as adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity","armGroupLabels":["semaglutide 2.4 mg (placebo)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage Change in Body Weight","description":"Percentage change in body weight from baseline (week 0) to end of treatment (week 68) is presented.
